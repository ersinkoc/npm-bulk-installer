## Development Guidelines

### Script Standards

#### Batch (.bat)
- Test on Windows 10 and Windows 11
- Use `setlocal enabledelayedexpansion` when needed

### Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")

- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

### Testing
